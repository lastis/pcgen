Blood Curse	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	SCHOOL:Necromancy	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:60 feet	COMPS:V, S	DURATION:1 round		DESC:You gamble some of your own life force on a curse that bedevils your enemy but may empower you. You may not cast this spell if you currently have less than 5 hit points. Choose a target within range that can see or hear you. The target makes a Wisdom save. If it fails, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage. You also take the same amount of psychic damage, which cannot be reduced or redirected in any way. Before the beginning of your next turn, if the target is hit with an attack, it takes an additional 1d4 necrotic damage, and the spell ends. When this happens, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier plus the amount of necrotic damage the creature took. The necrotic damage increases by an extra 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
Catfeet	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	SCHOOL:Abjuration	CASTTIME:1 reaction	RANGE:Self	COMPS:V	DURATION:Instantaneous		DESC:Use when you would take damage from falling. You gain resistance to damage from falling. If you fall less than 30 feet, you land on your feet instead of falling prone unless you take damage from the fall equal to more than half your maximum Hit Points.
Challenger's Mark	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:5 feet	COMPS:V, S	DURATION:1 round		DESC:As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you exchange a moment of silent, instinctive communication that expresses your personal challenge. Before the beginning of your next turn, if the target willingly moves more than 30 feet away from you or attacks a creature besides you, it immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage, and the spell ends. This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target, and the damage the target suffers for moving more than 30 feet away from you increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.
Create Poison	SOURCEPAGE:p.37	SCHOOL:Transmutation (ritual)	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Self (one vessel on your person)	COMPS:V, S, M (a small bottle or other container)	DURATION:Instantaneous		DESC:You use some combination of scavenged substances, focused meditation, and magic to transform the water in a container you have on your person into a one dose of improvised poison. This dose can be applied to one weapon, up to three pieces of ammunition, or up to three separate portions of food or drink. Once applied, the poison retains potency until someone must roll a saving throw against it, or for 1 minute, after which point it dries or dissolves. If a creature is struck with the poisoned weapon or ammunition, or if it ingests the poisoned food or drink, it must make a Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 minute and take 1d8 poison damage, or 2d8 if the poison is ingested. Creatures that succeed on their save take half damage, but suffer no other effects. A poison you create can only be used by you, and has no value if you try to sell it. If you cast this spell again, any doses of poison you have previously created with this spell instantly become water again. Otherwise, poison doses created with this spell retain their potency until the next time damage, but suffer no other effects. A poison you create can only be used by you, and has no value if you try to sell it. If you cast this spell again, any doses of poison you have previously created with this spell instantly become water again. Otherwise, poison doses created with this spell retain their potency until the next time you finish a long rest, at which point they return to being water. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional dose of poison for every two levels above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the poison gains an extra effect: if a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4.
Dead Man's Tell	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	SCHOOL:Divination (ritual)	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:Touch (one dead body part)	COMPS:V, M (one flexible part of a criminal's corpse)	DURATION:Until dispelled		DESC:You imbue a body part taken from a criminal's corpse, such as a hand, finger or head, with divinatory powers that cause it to react. Choose one of the categories of things it can detect and react to below. When something that falls within the chosen category or selected subcategories comes within 30 feet of the body part that has become the dead man's tell item, it activates. You can choose one of the following categories of things to activate the dead man's tell item: Alignment. Choose one of the following alignments: good, evil, lawful, or chaotic. The dead man's tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of a creature that has such an alignment. Consecration/Desecration. The dead man's tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of a place or object that has been magically consecrated or desecrated. Creature. Select one or more types of creatures from the following list: aberrations, beasts, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. You can also choose one or more races of humanoids (such as humans or goblins). You can choose as many or as few of these types as you like. The dead man's tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of one of the chosen creature types. Disease. The dead man's tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of an object or creature that carries a disease with which it can infect other creatures. Magic. Choose magic items, spellcasting, scrying attempts, or general magical effects. The dead man's tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of one of the chosen effects. Poison. The dead man's tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of poison or poisonous creatures, Secret Door. The dead man's tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of a secret door. Trap. The dead man's tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of a hidden trap or disguised pit or snare. The first time the dead man's tell item detects one or more of the chosen category or subcategories of subjects within 30 feet, it activates. When activated, the ite violently spasms for one round; a hand clenches, a finger jerks, jaws chatter and the like. The dead man's tell item does not indicate the power or location of the subject it has detected, merely its presence within 30 feet at the time of its activation. After being activated, the spell ends, and the body part rapidly decays and dessicates (meaning the same body part cannot be used for this spell again once it has been activated). Subjects are not detected by the dead man's tell item if they are separated from it by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood of dirt, or if they are protected by an effect that prevents divination (such as a nondetection spell). The same spellcaster cannot have multiple dead man's tell items affected with this spell at once. When you cast the dead man's tell spell again, any previous castings of this spell end immediately.
Dread Mercy	SOURCEPAGE:p.38	SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 reaction, which you take when you reduce creature within 60 feet to 0 hit points with a weapon attack.	RANGE:60 feet	COMPS:V	DURATION:10 minutes		DESC:You offer an opponent mercy in exchange for their cooperation. Choose one creature within range that you have just reduced to 0 hit points. You instead reduce that creature to 1 hit point and immediately command their surrender. It must immediately make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature is frightened of you for the spell's duration, and suffers only the normal effects of being frightened. On a failure, the creature is still frightened, but rather than fleeing, the frightened creature stays where it is and does not move unless you tell it to. For the duration of the spell, the creature that failed its save will not attack you, and it fearfully obeys any instructions it can hear and understand that will not directly harm it (for example, it will not knowingly drink poison or walk off a cliff). It will not deliberately say anything to you that it believes to be a lie, though it can simply remain silent if you do not ask any direct questions. If you ask it a direct question that can be answered in one or two sentences, it will not give you an answer that it considers false, though it may leave things out, especially if you ask a question that takes more than one or two sentences to answer. It may avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie by giving short or evasive answers, as long as what it does say remains within the boundaries of what it believes to be the truth. Whenever you or one of your allies attempt to harm the creature, or if you give it instructions that would harm it, or whenever you force it to make a saving throw against another effect, it repeats its Wisdom saving throw against this spell, ending the effects of the initial failed save on a success. You always know if a creature has succeeded or failed on a saving throw against this spell. When the spell's effect ends, the creature is unaware it was ever affected by this spell, knowing you could have killed it and believing its fear of you was merely natural. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 3rd level or higher spell slot, the duration is increased to 1 hour. If you use a 5th level or higher spell slot, the duration is increased to 8 hours.

Fiery Wrath	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	SCHOOL:Conjuration	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:60 feet	COMPS:S, M (a candlewick)	DURATION:Instantaneous		DESC:You create fire with only the concentrated power of your inner rage. Choose any flammable object within range. If it is not on someone's person, it suddenly bursts into flames. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the fire exploded must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or 1 point of fire damage on a successful one. You then choose one creature within the affected area and make a ranged spell attack against the creature. On a hit, that creature takes 1d6 psychic damage and must choose to either immediately fall prone or take an additional 1d6 fire damage at the beginning of their next turn. If a creature has the flammable object on their person, you must make the ranged spell attack first, and must choose to make the attack against that creature. If you hit, it suffers the same effects from your ranged spell attack described above, and the object bursts into flames. Each creature within 5 feet of the ignited object must then make the Dexterity saving throw as normal. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
Fist of Rage	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:90 feet	COMPS:V, S	DURATION:Instantaneous		DESC:You focus your thoughts into a burst of aggressive emotion that you unleash as a blow of telekinetic force. Make a ranged spell attack against a target you can see within range. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d6 psychic damage, and if the creature is Large or smaller, you push the creature up to 5 feet away from you. This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
Frightful Strike	SOURCEPAGE:p.39	SCHOOL:Enchantment	CASTTIME:1 action	RANGE:5 feet	COMPS:V, M (a weapon with at least one drop of blood on it)	DURATION:1 round		DESC:You bark or whisper a terrifying threat to the creature your weapon strikes. As part of the action of casting this spell, you must make a melee attack against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, in addition to the attack's normal effect, the creature struck takes an additional amount of psychic damage equal to 1d4 plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage is increased by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and also a black web of necrotic energy radiates across its skin from where it was struck until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly takes a reaction before then, it immediately takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and the spell ends. This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target, and the damage the target suffers for taking a reaction or opportunity attack increases to 2d8.
