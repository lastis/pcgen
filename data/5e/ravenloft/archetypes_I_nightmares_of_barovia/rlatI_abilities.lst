Dark One	KEY:The Dark Powers ~ Dark One	SORTKEY:Class	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality 	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:Starting at 1st level, creatures favored by the Dark Powers recognize you as one of their own. When a creature that is undead or any kind of lycanthrope attacks you with an attack or a harmful spell, it must first make a Charisma saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack. If you attack a creature or cast a spell that targets it, that creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.									
Friend of Horror	KEY:The Dark Powers ~ Friend of Horror	SORTKEY:Class	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality 	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:At 6th level, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals psychic damage or necrotic damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. For an hour after casting such a spell, you gain resistance to necrotic damage and psychic damage.									
Intimidating Presence	KEY:The Dark Powers ~ Intimidating Presence	SORTKEY:Class	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality 	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. If it succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.									
Offering to the Mists	KEY:The Dark Powers ~ Offering to the Mists	SORTKEY:Class	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warlock Class Feature.SpecialQuality 	SOURCEPAGE:p.24	DESC:Starting at 14th level, when a creature fails a saving throw against a spell you cast that inflicts damage, you can offer that creature to the Dark Powers as a possible pawn. The Mists rise up from beneath the creature’s feet and transport it elsewhere, showing it the most wicked acts it has performed and images of the punishments it deserves for them. They say some future Dark Lords were first brought the Dark Powers’ attention by means of this feature. You can only use this feature on one creature at a time, even if multiple creatures failed the saving throw. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. The target takes 6d12 necrotic damage. Also, its movement is halved until the end of its next turn, and if it is not undead, for 1 minute it becomes indifferent about creatures of your choice that it was hostile toward before you offered it to the Mists. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the minute ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise. If the creature is undead, both you and it take an additional 3d12 psychic damage, as you both endure the rage of the Dark Powers at being offered something they already consider their own. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
